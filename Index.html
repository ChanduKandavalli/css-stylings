       <div><h3><u>In the world view</u> </h3>
        <p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-215131834626d331377e384a29ed7364-c" width="360" height="300" alt="India picture">According to India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who tailored its world-view during
            the initial phase, two aspects of India’s world-view, namely, the ‘positive aspect of peace’ and
            the desire to promote ‘a larger degree of co-operation among nations,’ were based on India’s
            past thinking on the formulation of foreign policy. It is therefore necessary to discuss those socially
            accepted traditional values, which are expressed either in writings of thinkers or embodied in
            ancient institutions and customs that inculcate peaceful attitudes and practices notwithstanding
            imperfections or shortcomings in these ideals and objectives native to India.
                    <br> Five aspects of India’s traditional values have a bearing on the evolution of its world-view, namely,
preference for a middle way, tolerance, idealist and realist traditions, absence of imperialist tradition,
and a habit of expressing positive ideas through negative terms.

       <div> <h3><u>DIVERSITY</u> </h3>
        <p>India remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world. Apart from its many religions and sects, India is home to innumerable castes and tribes, as well as to more than a dozen major and hundreds of minor linguistic groups from several language families unrelated to one another. Religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains, still account for a significant proportion of the population; collectively, their numbers exceed the populations of all countries except China. Earnest attempts have been made to instill a spirit of nationhood in so varied a population, but tensions between neighbouring groups have remained and at times have resulted in outbreaks of violence. Yet social legislation has done much to alleviate the disabilities previously suffered by formerly “untouchable” castes, tribal populations, women, and other traditionally disadvantaged segments of society. At independence, India was blessed with several leaders of world stature, most notably Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who were able to galvanize the masses at home and bring prestige to India abroad. The country has played an increasing role in global affairs.
